AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence 
      and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper.
      METHODS: Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by
      cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers
      for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition,
      depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma
      history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its
      allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and
      gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. 
      The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant
      difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no
      significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of
      intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a
      higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele 
      frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical
      symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference 
      in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment.
      After treatment, the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were significantly
      decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The
      frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes.
      CONCLUSION: ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical
      symptoms and the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in patients with intracranial
      arachnoid cysts.

TI  - Genetic testing in fetuses with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum.
PG  - 1-201
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2019.1660769 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The objectives of this study were to explore genetics pathogenesis of
      isolated agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and assess the utility of chromosomal 
      microarray analysis (CMA) for genetic diagnosis of Isolated ACC. Methods: We
      analyzed the genomes of 16 fetuses with isolated ACC using Afymetrix CytoScan HD 
      arrays and conducted further bioinformatic analysis for one proband fetus with an
      abnormal copy number variation (CNV). Results: Of the 16 fetal samples examined, 
      2 (12.5%) had pathogenic CNVs and 3 (18.75%) had variants of unknown
      significance. Two cases, case 2 and case 9, were found to have pathogenic CNVs.
      Bioinformatic analyses indicated that the CNV of one fetus (case 9) contained 115
      annotated coding genes, 5 of which (SLC6A5, BDNF, ELP4, PAX6, and SLC1A2) have
      been associated with neurodevelopment. Three of these genes (SLC1A2, BDNF, and
      PAX6) may play a key role in ACC development. GO cluster analysis of the
      implicated genes revealed strong representations of protein binding and metal ion
      binding functions. KEGG pathway analysis pointed to four pathways: longevity
      regulating pathway, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cocaine addiction, and
      autophagy-animal. Conclusions: BDNF, SLC1A2, and PAX6 may be involved in the
      development of isolated ACC. CMA is a feasible technology for prenatal diagnosis 
      of isolated ACC.

TI  - Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating SHORTROOT
      Transcription.
PG  - 220-232
LID - 10.1104/pp.18.00534 [doi]
AB  - SHORTROOT (SHR) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots, but how its expression is regulated is 
      unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six
      subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of SHR Depletion of
      Elongator drastically reduced SHR expression and led to defective root stem cell 
      maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of 
      Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the elp1 mutant
      to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction
      of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II,
      support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription
      elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of
      SHR and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on
      the SHR gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4,
      a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the SHR
      locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with
      SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of SHR.
